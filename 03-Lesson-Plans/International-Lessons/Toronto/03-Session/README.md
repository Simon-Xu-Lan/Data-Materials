    <summary><strong> ‚≠ê Review: ER vs EC (15 min)</strong></summary>

We‚Äôve spoken to thousands of employers, and we know exactly what employers are looking for in top candidates. These conversations have led us to identify that there is a difference between being **employer-ready** and** employer-competitive.**

**Key Takeaways **to share with students:

**Employer-ready students** have a resume and a polished GitHub ready to go.

**Employer-competitive students **have these, but are also ready with building their visibility in the local market, they‚Äôre prepared for interviews, and are actively engaged in applying to jobs (at the right stage, of course!).

In fact, we know the following local agencies are actively recruiting in the Toronto area right now.
