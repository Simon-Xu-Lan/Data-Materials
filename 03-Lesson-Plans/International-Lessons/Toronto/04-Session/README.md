# Flex Session #4: Technical Interviewing

## Overview

**Technical interviewing is a learned skill** - it‚Äôs not something that anybody is naturally good at. It takes lots of practice to be able to apply one‚Äôs knowledge to a problem in a high-pressure environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* **Understand** what a technical interview is and when to expect it
* **Know** how to tackle problems they face in the technical interview

## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes

This lesson is built around an article written by Shums Kassam, Co-Founder of Hatchways, a Toronto based recruiting agency that matches candidates with paid work placements to aid them in building their skills and experience in a technical field.

    <summary><strong> üéâ Everyone Do: Just Between Friends (10 min)</strong></summary>

Students will have spent many hours alone this week, working through asynchronous Canvas lesson plans. Some will have been moving confidently and feeling great; others will have been struggling or feeling overwhelmed. This is a moment for students to connect with others, receive empathy and emotional support for their experiences, and get geared up for a positive class, no matter what their week was like and no matter how much of their content they have completed.

    * Just Between Friends: How would you explain what you‚Äôve learned so far this week to your best friend.

This is your time to introduce a few of the items we‚Äôll be discussing today. Beneath each of the sub headers below are some talking points that might be worth mentioning to students.

#### **Hatchways**

*   [Hatchways](https://www.hatchways.io/) is a platform designed to match candidates with paid work placements, and help them in obtaining their first software engineering job. 
*   It is a Toronto based start-up company.

#### **Recruiting Agencies**

*   Recruiting agencies come in many shapes and sizes; some a large corporations, and others are just a handful of people at very small companies. 
*   It is important to build relationships with recruiters who often have access to jobs that are not publicly posted
*   Some recruiters are really awesome to work with, others will waste your time
*   Be open to taking the initial phone call, but ask to see a job description first
*   Be honest with the recruiter about what you‚Äôre looking for
*   Remember, they get paid the more you earn, so don‚Äôt be shy about pushing for them to get you a higher starting salary

#### **Technical Interviewing**

*   Technical interviewing is just that‚Äîa stage of interviewing that assesses your technical ability to complete the job
*   Technical interviews may include whiteboarding, answering questions, take-home tests and/or assignments
*   They usually take place after the initial interviewing with HR/recruiting/hiring managers to see if you‚Äôre a good ‚Äúcultural‚Äù fit for the company
*   It‚Äôs not always about what you get right or wrong; often it‚Äôs about how you approach a problem. 
*   Try and have fun with it.

    <summary><strong> ‚úèÔ∏è Students Do: Acing the Technical Interview: Lessons from 30 Tech Companies (10 min)</strong></summary>

*   Slack out the following article: [https://medium.com/hatchways/acing-the-technical-interview-lessons-from-30-tech-companies-386fdc073425](https://medium.com/hatchways/acing-the-technical-interview-lessons-from-30-tech-companies-386fdc073425)
*   Let students know that this article is based on full-stack web development interviews in Toronto based start ups‚Äîbut the content is very applicable to all tech fields, including Data, in the Toronto area
*   Have students read through the article

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong> ‚úèÔ∏è Students Do: Discussion (10 min)</strong></summary>

*   In groups of 2 or 3, ask the students to discuss the article and write down anything they learned that was new or interesting to them.

    <summary><strong> ‚≠ê Review: Discussion (15 min)</strong></summary>

Instructor Reviews should bring the class back together if they were broken into Breakout rooms, and then review in one of the following ways: ask for volunteers to provide their results, have the instructor walk through the solution, ask students to lead reviews for other student work, provide prompts to ensure that students truly understood the underlying concepts, and finally provide feedback telling students what they must do to ensure they have what they need for the Challenge. 

*   Ask students what their insights were on the article about technical interviewing in Toronto
    1.  Possible insights you might mention:
        * One of the questions is ‚Äú**HOW** do you code?‚Äù Oftentimes, the how is more important than your ability to do it.
        * Relevant experience. How can we tie in student experiences from the Boot Camp (lessons, projects, homeworks) to real-life professional scenarios they will tackle
*   When tackling a coding problem in a technical interview, it is important to follow these steps:
    1. Comprehension
        *   Make sure you understand the question you are trying to answer. If there is any confusion, it‚Äôs totally okay to ask the interviewer for clarification
    2. Discussion / Pseudocode
        *   Pseudocode first. This helps you outline the solution.
    3. Code, keep it simple
        *   Always go for code that works first‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt have to be pretty. Get something working
    4. Optimization
        *   If you manage to get a working solution and there‚Äôs still time left over, now you can take some time to optimize it.
    5. Test
        *   All going well, test your code‚Äîthough to be fair, it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll need to do this in an interview!
